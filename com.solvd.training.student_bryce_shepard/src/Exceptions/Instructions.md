# 1. What is an exceptionâ€™s hierarchy? / 2. Why do we need the exception hierarchy? 
From object, you get Throwable which allows the compiler and JRE to throw errors and exceptions
From throwable you get Error, which is not something controlled by the developer, and also
Exception. Error means there's a problem with the code fundamentally, Exception means there's a
problem with the execution and implementation. Under Exception, you have RuntimeException which
are not thrown by code we write typically, and we should not try to. This hierarchy allows you to
inherit behavior
